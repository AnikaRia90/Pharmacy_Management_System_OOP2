# Pharmacy Management System (OOP2)

**Pharmacy Management System** is a **C# application** developed to manage pharmacy operations efficiently. The system is designed for academic purposes in **OOP2** and demonstrates the practical application of **object-oriented programming principles**, role-based access control, and structured data management in real-world pharmacy workflows.  

The project focuses on streamlining medicine management, user handling, and billing processes, ensuring that the system is modular, maintainable, and secure. It is built with **.NET** and uses **SQL Server** as the backend database.  



## Project Overview

The Pharmacy Management System allows pharmacies to manage day-to-day operations in a structured manner. The system provides functionality for:

- **Medicine Management:** Adding, updating, deleting, and viewing medicines in the inventory  
- **Billing and Invoicing:** Generating bills for customers and maintaining transaction history  
- **User Management:** Managing employees and customers with role-specific access  

The system implements **role-based access control** to ensure that users can only perform actions relevant to their roles. This design improves security and operational efficiency while providing a clear hierarchy of responsibilities.  



## User Roles

The system supports three types of users, each with distinct permissions:

### Admin
- Can manage all user accounts including employees and customers  
- Add, update, or delete medicines from the inventory  
- View and manage all billing records  
- Oversee the overall pharmacy operations  

### Employee
- Manage medicines (add or update stock as required)  
- Create bills for customers  
- Assist in the daily operational tasks of the pharmacy  

### Customer
- Login to the system securely  
- View available medicines and their details  
- Purchase medicines and receive bills for their transactions  

This separation of roles ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive operations, maintaining data integrity and operational security.  



## Core Features

The Pharmacy Management System incorporates the following core features:

- **Role-Based Authentication:** Secure login system that restricts access based on user roles  
- **Medicine Management:** Full CRUD operations on medicines with proper validation  
- **Billing and Invoice Generation:** Create bills for customers and maintain transactional records  
- **User Management:** Admin can manage employees and customers effectively  
- **Structured Data Handling:** Ensures safe and consistent storage of all information  
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Implements OOP2 principles including encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction for modularity and maintainability  



## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET  
- **Database:** SQL Server  
- **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP2)  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio  



## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to develop a **comprehensive pharmacy management system** that:  

- Demonstrates **object-oriented programming concepts** in a real-world application  
- Implements **role-based access control** to improve security  
- Provides **efficient and accurate medicine management**  
- Supports **billing, invoicing, and transaction tracking**  
- Maintains a **clean, modular, and maintainable code structure**  

This project showcases the application of **OOP2 concepts** in a practical scenario, preparing students to design and develop structured software solutions for real-world business needs.
